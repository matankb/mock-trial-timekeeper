      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy outlines how "Mock Trial Timer" collects, uses, and
        protects your data when you use our application. We take your privacy
        seriously and are committed to ensuring that your personal information
        remains secure. Please read this policy carefully to understand how we
        handle your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        The Mock Trial Timer app does not collect or transmit any personal data
        to external servers or third parties. All data related to your mock
        trial sessions, including timers and performance statistics, is stored
        locally on your device. We do not have access to, collect, or store any
        of this data.
      </p>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        To provide the core functionality of the app, Mock Trial Timer may
        request certain device permissions, such as access to your device's
        storage to save and retrieve data. These permissions are solely used to
        ensure the proper functioning of the app and the secure storage of your
        trial-related information.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take measures to protect the data you create and store within the
        Mock Trial Timer app. While the app may request permissions to access
        your device's storage, this data remains on your device and is not
        transmitted over the internet or to any external servers. We recommend
        keeping your device secure with passwords or biometric authentication
        methods to protect your trial data from unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in the app or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted within the
        app, and the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this policy will be
        revised accordingly. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to
        stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
      </p>
