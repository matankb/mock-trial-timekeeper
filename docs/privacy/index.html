    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy outlines how "Mock Trial Timekeeper"
      collects, uses, and protects your data when you use our application. We
      take your privacy seriously and are committed to ensuring that your
      personal information remains secure. Please read this policy carefully to
      understand how we handle your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>

    <p>
      The Mock Trial Timekeeper app does not collect or transmit any personal
      data to external servers or third parties. All data related to your mock
      trial sessions, including timers and performance
      statistics, is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to,

    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>

    <p>
      To provide the core functionality of the app, Mock Trial Timekeeper may
      request certain device permissions, such as access to your device's
      storage to save and retrieve data. These permissions are solely used to
      ensure the proper functioning of the app and the secure storage of your
      trial-related information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>
      We take measures to protect the data you create and store within the Mock
      Trial Timekeeper app. While the app may request permissions to access your
      device's storage, this data remains on your device and is not transmitted
      over the internet or to any external servers. We recommend keeping your
      device secure with passwords or biometric authentication methods to
      protect your trial data from unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
      the app or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted within the app,
      and the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of this policy will be
      revised accordingly. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically to
      stay informed about how we protect your privacy.
